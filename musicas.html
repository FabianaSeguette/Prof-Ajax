            <h3>Letra</h3>
            <p>Just a scar somewhere down inside of me<br>
            Something I can not repair<br>
            Even though it will always be<br>
            I pretend it isn't there (this is how I feel)<br>
            I'm trapped in yesterday (just stay out of my way)<br>
            Where the pain is all I know (this is all I know)<br>
            And I'll never break away (can't break free)<br>
            'Cause when I'm alone<br>
            I'm lost in these memories<br>
            Living behind my own illusion<br>
            Lost all my dignity<br>
            Living inside my own confusion<br>
            But I'm tired, I will always be afraid<br>
            Of the damage I've received<br>
            Broken promises they made<br>
            And how blindly I believed (this is all I know)<br>
            I will never break away (can't break free)<br>
            'Cause when I'm alone<br>
            I'm lost in these memories<br>
            Living behind my own illusion<br>
            Lost all my dignity<br>
            Living inside my own confusion<br>
            I try to keep this pain inside but I will never be alright<br>
            I try to keep this pain inside but I will never be alright<br>
            (I'm lost) I try to keep this pain inside but I will never be alright<br>
            (I'm lost) I try to keep this pain inside but I will never be alright<br>
            I'm lost in these memories<br>
            Living behind my own illusion<br>
            Lost all my dignity<br>
            Living inside my own confusion</p>

            <h3>Letra</h3>
            <p> Take me down to the river bend<br>
                Take me down to the fighting end<br>
                Wash the poison from off my skin<br>
                Show me how to be whole again<br>
                Fly me up on a silver wing<br>
                Past the black where the sirens sing<br>
                Warm me up in a nova's glow<br>
                And drop me down to the dream below<br>
                'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass<br>
                Hardly anything there for you to see<br>
                For you to see<br>
                Bring me home in a blinding dream<br>
                Through the secrets that I have seen<br>
                Wash the sorrow from off my skin<br>
                Show me how to be whole again<br>
                'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass<br>
                Hardly anything there for you to see<br>
                For you to see<br>
                'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass<br>
                Hardly anything else I need to be<br>
                'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass<br>
                Hardly anything there for you to see<br>
                For you to see<br>
                For you to see</p>

            <h3>Letra</h3>
            <p>Crawling in my skin<br>
               These wounds, they will not heal<br>
               Fear is how I fall<br>
               Confusing what is real<br>
               There's something inside me<br>
               That pulls beneath the surface<br>
               Consuming, confusing<br>
               This lack of self control I fear is never ending<br>
               Controlling, I can't seem<br>
               To find myself again<br>
               My walls are closing in<br>
               Without a sense of confidence<br>
               I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take<br>
               I've felt this way before, so insecure<br>
               Crawling in my skin<br>
               These wounds, they will not heal<br>
               Fear is how I fall<br>
               Confusing what is real<br>
               Discomfort, endlessly has pulled itself upon me<br>
               Distracting, reacting<br>
               Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection<br>
               It's haunting, how I can't seem<br>
               To find myself again<br>
               My walls are closing in<br>
               Without a sense of confidence<br>
               I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take<br>
               I've felt this way before, so insecure<br>
               Crawling in my skin<br>
               These wounds, they will not heal<br>
               Fear is how I fall<br>
               Confusing what is real<br>
               Crawling in my skin<br>
               These wounds, they will not heal<br>
               Fear is how I fall<br>
               Confusing, confusing what is real<br>
               (There's something inside me)<br>
               (That pulls beneath the surface)<br>
               (Consuming)<br>
               Confusing what is real<br>
               (This lack of self control I fear is never ending)<br>
               Controlling<br>
               Confusing what is real</p>
